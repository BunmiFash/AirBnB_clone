This is the first part of the AirBnB project.
The following are the tasks carried out in the course of the project:
- put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of future instances.
- create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file.
- create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Placeâ€¦) that inherit from BaseModel.
- create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage. All objects are stored here.
- create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine.

## THE CONSOLE
A command interpreter is used to manipulate data without a visual ineterface.
Objects can be created, retreived, updated or deleted from the command line.
